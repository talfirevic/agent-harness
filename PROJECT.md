# PROJECT

## Problem
Provide an agent-first harness that can create and develop complex software projects from a single idea with minimal human intervention.

## Users
- Product owners who want rapid project bootstrapping.
- Engineering teams that need safe parallel agent execution.

## MVP Scope
- One-command idea-to-project initialization.
- Parallel-safe autonomous execution lane.
- Mechanical quality and traceability gates.

## Non-Goals
- Replacing human ownership for legal or policy decisions.
- Removing all human oversight from production operations.

## Success Metrics
- New project scaffold generated in one command.
- CI gates enforce all defined harness principles.
- Autonomous lane can complete and verify phase work with no manual product coding.
