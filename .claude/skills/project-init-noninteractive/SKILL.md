description: Convert a single idea and defaults into PROJECT.md and REQUIREMENTS.md without non-blocking interviews.
---

Execution contract:
1. Read the idea and defaults.
2. Write `PROJECT.md` with scope, non-goals, constraints, and success metrics.
3. Write `REQUIREMENTS.md` with stable `REQ-###` IDs and acceptance criteria.
4. Update `.planning/ASSUMPTIONS.md` for every defaulted field.
5. Commit docs with a traceable message.
